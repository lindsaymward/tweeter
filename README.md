# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone which was used to practice front-end development skills and practices. All server files were supplied by Lighthouse Labs along with some basic HTML and CSS files to start. 

This repository utilizes HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, along with interacting with the Node and Express back-end.

Basic functionality included allows the app to load some pre-determined tweets from the database, and the user can submit their own tweets to add to the feed via the form. Trying to submit an empty form or more than 140 characters will result in an error message.

## Getting Started

1. Clone your repository onto your local device.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
